# Overlord
Overlord is an automated network device database built to facilitate rapid OpenFlow network configuration. By using each hostâ€™s source mac address as an unique identifier, Overlord is able to detect changes in host IP addresses, source port numbers, and top-of-rack DPIDs. Overlord also provides basic layer2 packet forwarding, and network group creation.
Important: Overlord only uses ARP to update its internal database.
